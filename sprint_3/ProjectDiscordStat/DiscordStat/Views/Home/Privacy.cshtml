    <h1>Two Levels of Information we collect and how:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Discord user info by logging in with discord.</h2></li>
        <p>Once you log in with discord we have minimal access to your info. We use that to create your user "Account"" page and store whats on your user 
           page into our database. The third party database we use privacy page can be found here: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/PrivacyStatement">Azure in Microsoft</a>
        </p>
        <li><h2>Discord server info by adding our bot to an owned server.</h2></li>
        <p>When adding our bot to a server you must be the owner(the one who created it), and you must already have logged in through discord.
           Only servers that have our bot will be stored in our database. Servers in our database are shown on a page for all user to view and 
           request to be a member.
        </p>
    </ul>
