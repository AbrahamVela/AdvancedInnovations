### One thing Iâ€™ll do to take something out of the loathed column:
K: Research postman<br>
E: Don't take a story involving identity or authentication<br>
A: Make sure user story is what i want before a sprint starts.

### One action taken to amplify something in the Loved column:
K: Spend even more time writing user stories<br>
E: Continue to work on testing <br>
A: Stick to completing user stories throughout the sprint

### Use your LONGED FOR and LEARNED lists to help shape your ideas for what actions to take:
K: Clean up existing code and double check for possible errors.<br>
E: Continue on learning linq and focus on more detailed user stories.<br>
A: I guess for me it'll be to learn how to test javascript and work on user stories.
