Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    What processes are we following?  How will we run this project? ==> Agile, Scrum, ...  
    What are we choosing to do, how will we do it and at what level of detail or extent?

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
        Our shared vision is to create a Discord bot that can be added into servers by their owners. This bot will store user and server information to a database. Members of that server can then log into our website and see statistics such as the most popular time that games are played, what the most popular games are, what the most popular time to play a specific game is, the average play time for each game, who plays the most, and who is active the most. 

### Description of Clients/Users
[Personas](https://github.com/AbrahamVela/AdvancedInnovations/blob/dev/milestone_3/Personas.md)

    Our users are Discord server owners and the members of their servers.
