# Retrospective

## Loved
### Abraham:
* Api calling
* Unit testing with Moq
### Ethan:
* More experience with javascript
* Efficiency is much higher, as well as cleaner code
### Korbin:
* Working with the bot more.
* Good communication between the team.

## Learned
### Abraham:
* How to test controllers successfully
* Very little about specFlow
### Ethan:
* How to use Chart.js better
* Ways to stop duplication in the database
### Korbin:
* How to use javascript to edit the bot functionality.
* How to create charts with javascript

## longedFor
### Abraham:
* Successful unit testing with moq
* work with the bot more
### Ethan:
* Easier deployment on azure
* Specflow to work
### Korbin:
* A better UI
* Having better testing


## Loathed
### Abraham:
* Passing data through the viewPage
* Deploying to Azure
### Ethen:
* Specflow never working
* Chart.js not doing what it's supposed to
### Korbin:
* Specflow testing
* Merge conflicts


### One thing Iâ€™ll do to take something out of the loathed column:
K: Spend more time figuring out how use Specflow.<br>
E: Update the out of date Chart.js library and learn more about it<br>
A: Run what I was trying to do with the viewPage with one of the members and/or run it by Dr. Morse.

### One action taken to amplify something in the Loved column:
K: Take more stories that include using the bot to gather information.<br>
E: Continue to write cleaner code when possible <br>
A: I'll make sure to have code from my user story that'll have moq unit testing.

### Use your LONGED FOR and LEARNED lists to help shape your ideas for what actions to take:
K: Spend more time on making a clean UI instead of just throwing it on the page and saying it's done.<br>
E: Put more effort into Specflow to get it running<br>
A: I'll have to make sure to try writing my test first before coding and get help on the specFlow so I fully understand it.
