## GitHub  Stats
Create a bot that can be added into discord servers that will store user information to a database. Users can then log into a website that will pull that information and show the most popular time that games are played, what the most popular games are, who plays the most. It will also show monthly awards to the users who chat the most, spend the most time playing games, and spent the most time being idle. If chosen to the bot will also be able to send reminders in chat to drink water, take a break, adjust posture, etc. 

## Twitter Blocker
User can logs into our website with their twitter account and can either choose to use a list of blocked phrases and words that we have chosen or input their own terms that they don't want to see on their feed. The user can also choose if they want to block, mute, or hide the accounts that have said these words. Users will also be able to choose how many tweets they want to see in a given session to avoid spending too much time on Twitter.

## Spotify Playlist creator
User can enter a list of their favorite artists, songs, genres, as well as the mood they are in / type of music they are looking for. The site will then create a playlist that is customized to the information that they entered. When you are done listening to music you can either choose to delete that playlist or keep it to listen to at another time. There will be a separate section for choosing podcasts based on genres and the podcasts that the user has listened to before.
