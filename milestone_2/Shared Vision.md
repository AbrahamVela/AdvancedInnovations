	Our shared vision is to create a Discord bot that can be added into servers by their owners. This bot will store user and server information to a database. Members of that server can then log into our website and see statistics such as the most popular time that games are played, what the most popular games are, what the most popular time to play a specific game is, the average play time for each game, who plays the most, and who is active the most. The purpose of our bot is to bring members of discords servers together and help them choose what game to play with their friends and what the best time to play together is. We chose this topic because Discord is something that we all use to talk to our friends when we play video games. In our busy lives we have discovered that we donâ€™t have as much time to play video games as we would like. By being able to see the most active times of our friends we thought we could work with our schedules so we can still enjoy playing games with our friends. From what we have seen there are some websites that offer similar features to what we are proposing, however we think that the data that is collected and how the data is displayed could be optimized for a better user experience. The advanced features we are hoping to create in our project are also locked behind a monthly membership for most of the competitors, so creating a free alternative not only benefits us for our personal use, but also to anyone else who wishes to use it.
